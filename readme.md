# Friendsbook

A typical social media back end implemented in Microservice Architecture using Spring Boot + Netflix OSS.
It supports operations like sign-up, log-in, creating a post with images and text.

The application compromises of 2 functional microservices and 3 non-functional microservices.



**Functional**

1. [Config Service](https://github.com/Vaibhav5757/FriendsBook-Config-Server) - which pulls config from [Config](https://github.com/Vaibhav5757/FriendsBook-Config)
2. [Eureka Server](https://github.com/Vaibhav5757/FriendsBook-Eureka-Server) - for service discovery



**Non-Functional**

1. [User Service](https://github.com/Vaibhav5757/FriendsBook-User-Service)
2. [Post Service](https://github.com/Vaibhav5757/Friendsbook-Post-Service)
3. [Front End Service](https://github.com/Vaibhav5757/FriendsBook-Front-End-Service)
